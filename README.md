### What is this? ###

The NPC generator is a game system prototype for generating believable identities for Non Playing Characters in a game.

The data is modeled after real information from the city of Toronto. Being a place with huge diversity it provides interesting results when looking at random individuals on the street.

### How do I set it up? ###

Just download and open in a browser. Alternatively you can see a live version [here](http://www.planet34.org/box/prj/npcgen/).

It's purely HTML/JS so you don't need any server technology to run it.
