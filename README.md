### About

The NPC Identity Generator is a game system prototype for a sandbox type of game (e.g Grand Theft Auto). It creates _realistic_ identities for citizens of a virtual game world.

The data is _modeled_ after real information from the city of Toronto since they're so kind to make demographic data available. And also because it's a diverse place so it fits the bill for the idea of the prototype.
First/Last names have been compiled from all over the web according to popularity in their areas of origin.

You can see a working demo [here](http://www.planet34.org/box/prj/npcgen/).

Feel free to use the data (not the artwork) for whatever you want.
